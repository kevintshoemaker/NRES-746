## Group projects: expectations

Students are expected to perform (and write up the results for) a data analysis using *state-of-the-art analytical methods*. The write-up will loosely take the format of a scientific paper to be submitted to a professional journal. However, because of the nature of this course, the most important pieces of the write-up are the **methods** and **results** sections. Nonetheless, I expect at least a few paragraphs introducing the topic and why it's important, and a few paragraphs discussing the implications of the results. The methods and results section can (and in many cases should) be much longer than you typically see in a scientific paper- don't feel constrained by space for these sections! Not that you need to be wordy, I just want to make sure you have the space to clearly explain the analyses you performed and why you made the choices you did!

Here is a more detailed description of expectations for the final group project:

**Introduction:** Provide enough description so that the reader understands why the research is important and (if appropriate) what question(s) are being addressed. 

**Methods:**      
- Provide just enough details about the data collection to give the reader the context necessary to understand the data.    
- Provide plenty of detail about the analytical approach- enough detail to fully replicate the analysis. Justify all decisions that were made and (where appropriate) discuss why you did not use alternative approaches.   
- Discuss key analytical assumptions.  
NOTE: This section can be longer than the methods section of a standard manuscript.

**Results:** Present all relevant results completely and concisely. Wherever possible, results should be presented via figures and tables. There is a limit of 5 figures and 3 tables, so choose carefully which figures and tables to present. Figures should be *publication quality*.   

**Discussion:** Write at least three paragraphs that put the results in a larger context (returning to the key research questions) and discuss areas of uncertainty. Potential topics are possible violations of assumptions, and future work that your analysis suggests would be profitable.    

**Code** Provide all code used to run the analyses presented in the paper as an R script. 

## Picking a topic

Your final project should not be part of your thesis. That said, there is no requirement that your final project is not *relevant* to your graduate thesis project. You will end up spending quite a bit of time on your final projects, so think about what types of analyses you want/need to get to know better- ideally something that may strengthen your thesis project. 

## Picking a dataset

You are not required to use a public dataset, but there are lots of great datasets out there... see [links page](Links.html#Data_links)

## Group project overview ("proposal") (1 page, due 9/25/18)  

Please provide a 1-page project description. Make sure you include:

- Project title
- Participant names
- Participant roles (brief description of how you plan to divide the tasks up)
- Brief background (motivation for research question)
- Research question(s)   
- Primary and ancillary data sources
- Anticipated analytical approach  


## Group project oral presentations (in class, 12/11/18)

Each group will have 15 minutes allotted for group presentations, with a few minutes for questions. 

A simple presentation rubric can be found [here](Presentation rubric.docx)

Please provide a copy of your final presentation (e.g., PPTx file).

## Group project final paper (due Wed 12/19/18)

The written paper should be structured as a scientific paper:

**Introduction:** Provide enough description so that the reader understands why the research is important and (if appropriate) what question(s) are being addressed. 

**Methods:**      
- Provide just enough details about the data collection to give the reader the context necessary to understand the data.    
- Provide plenty of detail about the analytical approach- enough detail to fully replicate the analysis. Justify all decisions that were made and (where appropriate) discuss why you did not use alternative approaches.   
- Discuss key analytical assumptions.  
NOTE: This section can be longer than the methods section of a standard manuscript.

**Results:** Present all relevant results completely and concisely. Wherever possible, results should be presented via figures and tables. There is a limit of 5 figures and 3 tables, so choose carefully which figures and tables to present. Figures should be *publication quality*.   

**Discussion:** Write at least three paragraphs that put the results in a larger context (returning to the key research questions) and discuss areas of uncertainty. Potential topics are possible violations of assumptions, and future work that your analysis suggests would be profitable.   
**Code** Provide all code used to run the analyses presented in the paper as an R script.
