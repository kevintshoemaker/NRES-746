<div id="course-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
<p>Modern computers have reduced or eliminated many of the barriers to advanced data analysis, and as a result computational algorithms now often have primacy over elegant and simple mathematical formulae for complex data analysis. Armed with basic concepts of probability and statistics, and with some facility with computer programming, ecologists and natural resource professionals get more out of their data than ever before. <strong>In this course, we embrace the primacy of the algorithm</strong>.</p>
<p>By the end of this course, students should have the ability to (1) develop computational routines to simulate data generation under alternative mechanisms, (2) fit these computational models to data using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, (3) validate these computational models, and (4) understand where and when to use a wide variety of additional advanced data analysis methods. The goal is for students to emerge from this course as creative data analysts with the tools and intuition needed to draw inferences from a wide variety of data types.</p>
<p><strong>The course motto</strong>: <em>Be Dangerous</em>! What does that mean?? It is <em>safer</em> to use standard analytical tools (e.g., in a software like SAS or SPSS) because these methods have been validated and tested in many ways over the years. When we build our own algorithms, we can be entering uncharted territory. And exploring these territories can be dangerous… And daunting… And exciting!</p>
<p>The focus of this course is on using computational algorithms to infer ecological processes and relationships from pattern in <em>observational</em> studies; <em>we will not directly address experimental methods or design in this course</em>. However, the data analysis methods covered will be of broad utility for a wide variety of disciplines and data types. The general focus will be on predictive statistical modeling methods, including regression-based approaches, hierarchical/mixed models, and multi-model inference. Additional student-led modules will cover other advanced analysis topics such as classification and regression trees, structural equation modeling, and geographic models of species distributions. <em>This is not a “statistics” course per se</em>; we will focus on the implementation and leave the nitty-gritty stats questions to statisticians.</p>
<p>Each student will be responsible for leading discussions and demonstrations on a data analysis method of their choice (working in groups). The laboratory portion of the class will provide students the opportunity to try out some of the data analysis methods. Structured labs with example data sets will be interspersed with open lab periods where students work in small groups on a research project involving analysis of a real-world data set.</p>

<div id="student-learning-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Student Learning Objectives</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify and contrast the major classes of statistical models used by ecologists (e.g., Bayesian vs frequentist, likelihood-based, machine learning) and explain how and why ecologists use these models.</li>
<li>Apply analysis tools such as logistic regression, non-linear regression models, mixed-effects models, and machine-learning methods (e.g., Random Forest) on diverse data sets representative of those commonly considered in observational studies in ecology.</li>
<li>Learn to explore data sets quantitatively and graphically and to prepare data appropriately for analysis.</li>
<li>Perform statistical analysis, data visualization, simulation modeling, model validation and programming with the statistical computing language R.</li>
<li>Critically evaluate the strength of inferences drawn from statistical models by understanding and testing major assumptions and using tools such as cross-validation.</li>
<li>Communicate statistical and computational concepts by leading lectures and discussion on advanced topics in data analysis.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="prerequisites" class="section level3">
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Curious scientific mind, broad research interests, comfort with (or at least, lack of fear regarding) quantitative topics. Students are expected to already have a fundamental knowledge of relevant statistical methods, obtained through other coursework. If this is not the case, they should be prepared to work harder to develop the necessary prerequisite knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="textbooks-and-readings" class="section level3">
<h3>Textbooks and Readings</h3>
<p>We will use the book, <a href="https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/emdbook/">Ecological Models and Data in R</a>, by Ben Bolker, as a general class reference. However, additional readings will be assigned, and will be available on the course website.</p>
<p>In addition, readings will be assigned as indicated in the course schedule (which is still evolving!).</p>

<h3>Course components</h3>
<p><strong>Student-led presentations</strong>: Each student will be responsible for leading a lecture/discussion that introduces a data analysis method using a worked example (clear, concise, informative tutorial), and a discussion of applications from the published literature. Presenters are encouraged to work with the instructor (and other faculty, graduate students!) to better understand their data, methods, papers and topics.<br />
<strong>Class Participation</strong>: Students are expected to actively participate in the classroom education process. Don’t be afraid to ask questions- fear of embarrassment can be a major impediment to learning. So consider this a safe space for making mistakes- <em>be dangerous AND make a fool of yourself!</em><br />
<strong>Laboratory Reports</strong>: Students will submit (1) R functions that accomplish specific tasks (that will be graded using an automated algorithm- in R of course!), and (2) a brief report (submitted via a WebCampus discussion) succinctly answering any questions posed, and stating any questions or points of confusion. While students are encouraged to work on the labs in small groups, all lab submissions will be made individually.<br />
<strong>Group Projects</strong>: Students will work on projects in groups of 2 - 3. Projects will require analysis of previously published or publicly available data sets that are NOT intended to be part of a student’s planned thesis or dissertation chapters. The instructor can assist with identifying suitable data sets. Although a primary goal is to enhance knowledge and facility with the data analysis methods, an important secondary goal could be to develop a collaborative manuscript for publication! Therefore, careful thought should go into choice of a data set and relevant scientific questions to guide the analysis. The group project will take the form of a manuscript suitable for submission as a research paper. This will be submitted to the instructor as a complete draft by Dec 8, 2018, and (after review and comment by the instructor) as a final version by December 19.</p>
<div id="group-projects-expectations" class="section level4">
<h4>Group projects: expectations</h4>
<p>Students are expected to perform (and write up the results for) a data analysis using <em>state-of-the-art analytical methods</em>. The write-up will loosely take the format of a scientific paper to be submitted to a professional journal. However, because of the nature of this course, the most important pieces of the write-up are the <strong>methods</strong> and <strong>results</strong> sections. Nonetheless, I expect at least a few paragraphs introducing the topic and why it’s important, and a few paragraphs discussing the implications of the results. The methods and results section can (and in many cases should) be much longer than you typically see in a scientific paper- don’t feel constrained by space for these sections! Not that you need to be wordy, I just want to make sure you have the space to clearly explain the analyses you performed and why you made the choices you did!</p>
<p>Here is a more detailed description of expectations for the final group project:</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Provide enough description so that the reader (me!) understands why the research is important and (if appropriate) what hypotheses or ideas are being tested.</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> Provide some details about data collection, just enough to give the reader the context necessary to understand the data. Provide plenty of detail about the analytical approach- enough detail to fully replicate the analysis. Justify all decisions that were made and (where appropriate) discuss why you did not use alternative approaches. Discuss key analytical assumptions. This section can be longer than the methods section of a standard manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Present all relevant results completely and concisely. There is a limit of 5 figures and 3 tables, so choose carefully which figures and tables to present. Figures should be <em>publication quality</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> Write at least three paragraphs that put the results in a larger context and discusses areas of uncertainty. Potential topics are possible violations of assumptions, and future work that your analysis suggests would be profitable.</p>
<p><strong>Code</strong> Provide all code used to run the analyses presented in the paper as an R script.</p>
