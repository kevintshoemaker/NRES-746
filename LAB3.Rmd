#### Exercise 1

Working as a group, make up a fake data set in which the true data generating process is composed of a deterministic and stochastic component from the Bolker book. Be creative- make sure you can tell a plausible natural-resources related "story" about how these data were generated. 

Now, exchange your dataset with that generated from another group. Build likelihood functions for testing your framework.
